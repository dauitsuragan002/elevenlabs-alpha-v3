## How to use the official ElevenLabs TTS model: Eleven V3 with early access?

Official API returns a `403 model_access_denied` error:
`"You do not have access to Eleven v3 (alpha). For early access please contact sales."`

This script bypasses that by mimicking browser behavior — no API key or login required.
It uses the official API endpoint with different approaches.
