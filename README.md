# ElevenLabs non official API (for special v3 alpha models)

This project provides a Python non-official API for ElevenLabs. Supported Alpha v3 model voices.

## Note

This repository contains two separate methods for working with ElevenLabs:

- `method_1/` — contains the first approach (see `elevenlabs_client.py`, `example.py`).
- `method_2/` — contains the second approach (see `elevenlabs_tts.py`).

Choose the method that best fits your needs.
