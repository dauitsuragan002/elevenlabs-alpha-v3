## How to use the official ElevenLabs TTS model: Eleven V3 with early access

- Official API returns a `403 model_access_denied` error:  
  `"You do not have access to Eleven v3 (alpha). For early access please contact sales."`
- This script bypasses that by mimicking browser behavior — no API key or login required.
- It uses the public web demo endpoint to access v3 voices.

```

Error: 403
{"detail":{"status":"model\_access\_denied","message":"You do not have access to Eleven v3 (alpha). For early access please contact sales."}}

```

➡️ See the `method_2/` directory for a working example using the browser-based approach.

## Features

- ✅ Works without ElevenLabs API key
- ✅ Supports Alpha v3 voices
- ✅ No login or account required
⚠️ May stop working if too many unauthenticated requests are sent from the same IP (rate limit).

## Note

This repository contains two separate methods for working with ElevenLabs:

- `method_1/` — first approach using Playwright (`elevenlabs_client.py`, `example.py`)
- `method_2/` — second approach simulating browser demo behavior and official API (`elevenlabs_tts.py`)

Choose the method that best fits your needs.
