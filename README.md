## How to use ElevenLabs API TTS  model alpha v3 without early access

- Official API returns `403 model_access_denied` error:  
  `"You do not have access to Eleven v3 (alpha). For early access please contact sales."`
- This script bypasses that by mimicking browser requests (no API key or login needed).
- Uses public web demo endpoint to access v3 voices.

``Error: 403
{"detail":{"status":"model_access_denied","message":"You do not have access to Eleven v3 (alpha). For early access please contact sales."}}``

See directory method_2/

## Note

This repository contains two separate methods for working with ElevenLabs:

- `method_1/` — contains the first approach (see `elevenlabs_client.py`, `example.py`).
- `method_2/` — contains the second approach (see `elevenlabs_tts.py`).

Choose the method that best fits your needs.
